        <p style="color:black; justify-content: center; position: relative; left: 30px;">
            As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering, I am eager to embark on a dynamic career journey where I can leverage my academic foundation, innovative mindset, and passion <br> for the technical field to contribute meaningfully to a progressive organization. 
    
            With a solid understanding of Programming Languages and Tools, honed through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, <br> I am poised to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges.
    
            I have experience with:
            <ul style="color: black; justify-content: center; position: relative; left: 30px;">
                <li> Python, JavaScript</li>
                <li>Database Management Systems (SQL, NoSQL)</li>
                <li>Web Development (HTML/CSS, React, Node.js)</li>
                <li>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) methodologies</li>
                <li>Version Control Systems (Git)</li>
                <li>Agile development practices</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color:black; justify-content: center; position: relative; left: 30px;"> In addition to my technical skills, I have strong communication and teamwork abilities, developed through collaborative projects and presentations during my academic tenure. 
    
            Furthermore, <br>I have completed internships at resolution minds, where I gained practical experience in software development and contributed to the development of a new web application.
    
            I am driven by a relentless pursuit <br> of excellence and continuous learning, seeking opportunities to collaborate with diverse teams, tackle complex problems, and drive impactful solutions that promote business growth and enhance customer satisfaction. <br>
    
            My goal is to cultivate a fulfilling career path where I can continuously evolve, make a positive impact, and grow both personally and professionally, while making significant contributions to the success of the <br>organization I join.
